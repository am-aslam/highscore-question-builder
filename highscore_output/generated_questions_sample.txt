@title Algebra & Geometry Mini Assessment
@description A mini assessment containing two AI-generated math multiple-choice questions similar in style to the base questions. Each question preserves LaTeX where appropriate and follows the requested output format.

@question If $10x - 5 = 5x + 15$, what is the value of x?
@instruction Solve for x and choose the correct answer.
@difficulty easy
@Order 1

@option \(\frac{2}{3}\)
@option \(\frac{3}{2}\)
@@option Correct Answer
@option 4
@option 5

@explanation Subtract 5x from both sides: 5x - 5 = 15 -> 5x = 20 -> x = 4.
