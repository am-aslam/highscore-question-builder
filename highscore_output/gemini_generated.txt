@option [A] 10 meters
@@option Correct Answer [B] 10 meters
@option [C] 25 meters
@option [D] 5 meters
@explanation The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula $P = 2l + 2w$, where $P$ is the perimeter, $l$ is the length, and $w$ is the width.  We are given that $P = 50$ meters and $l = 15$ meters. Substituting these values into the formula, we get $50 = 2(15) + 2w$.  Simplifying, we have $50 = 30 + 2w$. Subtracting 30 from both sides gives $20 = 2w$. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that $w = 10$ meters.
